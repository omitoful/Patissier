# Part.1

## Learning Git and GitHub

* [Try git](https://try.github.io)
* [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com)

## Preparing your project

* **upstream** means the repository created by owner.

* **origin** means the repository forked by you.

From now on, we're going to start the project `PÃ¢tissier`. (in French)

1. Please fork this upstream from the GitHub.
2. Please clone the origin from the GitHub to your **local** machine.
3. Please find the `project` folder under the cloned repository and create a Xcode project with the name **Patissier** (in English) inside this folder.

## Assignment

Every time before you start a new assignment, please create a new branch with the following naming rules from the **master** branch on the origin and do your assignment on this new branch.

```
Branch naming rules:

  part-(part number)


Ex: Part.3

  => part-3
```

1. Please make your first commit for the changes using git.
2. Please push the current assignment branch to the origin.

## How to hand-in assigments?

Please find the assignment branch on your origin and make a pull request from this branch to **your name branch** of the upstream. (Please make sure never to make a pull request to the master of the upstream)

If your pull request gets rejected by me, it means that you must fix the problems I mention in the comment. You should check your email inbox daily to see if there comes any rejection.

Please fix the issues and push new commits to the same assignment branch. The pull request will automatically update itself so that you don't have to create another one for the same assignment.
